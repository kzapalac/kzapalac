# Hey there! I am Kennedy Zapalac! &emsp;
I am a Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) student at the McCombs School of Business, UT Austin, with a unique interdisciplinary background in psychology, business, and applied statistical modeling. I believe that many business challenges revolve around understanding people‚Äîwhether it's customers, coworkers, or stakeholders‚Äîand I bring a strong foundation in human behavior and data analysis to these challenges. I am passionate about using data-driven insights to solve problems that drive both business growth and societal value. Whether through everyday interactions with coworkers or by helping businesses make informed decisions, I am committed to positively impacting the lives of others, no matter how big or small. I am looking for professional opportunities that align with my skillset and passion for data science and that will support my ongoing learning. If you're interested in connecting, please contact me!

You will find a mix of my class projects and projects I completed as an undergraduate research assistant. I am unable to post some of my projects here due to privacy restrictions though.
