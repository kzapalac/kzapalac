# Hey there! I am Kennedy Zapalac! &emsp;
I am currently a fourth-year student at UT majoring in Psychology, minoring in Business, and working towards a Certificate in Applied Statistical Modeling. While deepening my understanding of people through my coursework, I have also developed the skills to discover insights from data, interpret research articles, and to communicate research findings in an accessible manner. I have discovered a passion for solving problems with data-driven solutions, and I have had the opportunity to exercise my problem-solving skills while collaborating on research. The next step in my journey involves fortifying my analytical skills through a graduate program. My greatest hope is that I can use the knowledge I have gained during my undergraduate studies and will gain during my graduate studies to positively impact the lives of others.

You will find a mix of my class projects and projects I completed as an undergraduate research assistant. I am unable to post some of my projects here due to privacy restrictions though.
