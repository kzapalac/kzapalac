# Hey there! I am Kennedy Zapalac! &emsp;
I am a student at the University of Texas at Austin majoring in Psychology minoring in Business, and working towards a Certificate in Applied Statistical Modeling. Data science was never on my radar before I began my undergraduate studies, but I unexpectedly fell in love with it after taking a class in Psychological Methods and Statistics where I was introduced to R. Since then I've worked to increase my skillset, becoming a truly interdiscplinary student with programming experience, statistcal knowledge, and psychological expertise. I'm still actively increasing my skillset so that one day I can positively impact the world by driving the creation of knowledge and directing decisions accordingly.
